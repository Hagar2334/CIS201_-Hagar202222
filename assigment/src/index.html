        <h2> 202212477 </h2>
		<p> Talking about myself is one of the hardest things I can do but I guess I should say somethings. I am Hagar and my major is Software Engineering .I really don't know what to say when it comes to this things I freeze.
		But I guess  I could say that I love swimming and listening to music .And something that I am planning to do is to  get my driver licences because I wanted  to drive for the longest time ever.
		Most of time I am at my room alone so I always like to draw and listen to music . My family say that my drawing is nice but I dont think so .
		I draw cause I am bored .I really want to graduate from  uni to see the experince of work and how I will work .It is scariest thing to know that your getting older but I guess that is what life is .
		I am curious to know what life is all about and what it will bring for me . Finally the last thing I will say I hope to be a well known software engineer and work in a big company .</p
